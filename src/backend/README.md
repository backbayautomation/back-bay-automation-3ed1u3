## Getting Started

### Installation

1. Clone the repository and set up Git hooks:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/organization/project
cd project/src/backend
pre-commit install
```

2. Install Poetry and configure virtual environment:
```bash
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
poetry config virtualenvs.in-project true
```

3. Install project dependencies:
```bash
poetry install
```

4. Configure environment variables:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration
```

5. Initialize development database:
```bash
poetry run alembic upgrade head
```

### Development Setup

1. Start required Docker services:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

2. Run database migrations and seed data:
```bash
poetry run python -m scripts.seed_data
```

3. Start development server:
```bash
poetry run uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

4. Access API documentation:
- OpenAPI UI: http://localhost:8000/docs
- ReDoc: http://localhost:8000/redoc

## Development Guidelines

### Code Quality

- Follow PEP 8 style guide
- Maintain test coverage above 85%
- Use type hints consistently
- Document all public APIs
- Run pre-commit hooks before commits

### Testing

```bash
# Run unit tests
poetry run pytest

# Run with coverage
poetry run pytest --cov=app

# Run integration tests
poetry run pytest tests/integration
```

### Database Migrations

```bash
# Create new migration
poetry run alembic revision --autogenerate -m "description"

# Apply migrations
poetry run alembic upgrade head

# Rollback migration
poetry run alembic downgrade -1
```

## Deployment

### Production Requirements

- AKS cluster with GPU nodes (NVIDIA Tesla T4 or better)
- Azure SQL Database (Business Critical tier)
- Azure Redis Cache (Premium tier)
- Azure Key Vault for secrets management

### Deployment Process

```bash
docker build -t product-search-backend:latest .
```

2. Deploy to AKS:
```bash
az aks get-credentials --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myAKSCluster
kubectl apply -f k8s/
```

3. Verify deployment:
```bash
kubectl get pods -n product-search
kubectl logs -f deployment/backend-deployment
```
